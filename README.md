# ⚖️ Slice Protocol Application

This project is the frontend implementation for **Slice**, a **Real-Time Dispute Resolution Protocol** built on Next.js. It features a **multi-tenant architecture** capable of running as a standalone PWA or as an embedded MiniApp across various wallet ecosystems (Base, Beexo).

**🔗 Live Demo**: [Testnet](https://dev.slicehub.xyz) | [Mainnet](https://app.slicehub.xyz)

## ⚡ What is Slice?

**Slice** is a **decentralized, real-time dispute resolution protocol**. It acts as a **neutral truth oracle** that resolves disputes quickly and trustlessly through **randomly selected jurors** and **economic incentives**.

We are building the **"Uber for Justice"**:
* **Decentralized & Trustless:** No central authority controls the outcome.
* **Fast & Scalable:** Designed for real-time applications, offering quick rulings compared to traditional courts.
* **Gamified Justice:** Jurors enter the Dispute Resolution Market via an **intuitive and entertaining App/MiniApp**.
* **Earn by Ruling:** Users stake tokens to become jurors and **earn money** by correctly reviewing evidence and voting on disputes.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Multi-Tenant & Strategy Pattern

This application uses a **Strategy Pattern** to manage wallet connections and SDK interactions. Instead of a single monolithic connection logic, we use an abstraction layer that selects the appropriate **Adapter** based on the runtime environment (detected via subdomains and SDK presence).

### 1. Connection Strategies

We support two active connection strategies (with Lemon planned):

| Strategy | Description | Used By |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Wagmi SW** | Uses Smart Wallets (Coinbase/Safe) via Privy & Wagmi. | **PWA**, **Base** |
| **Wagmi EOA** | Uses standard Injected (EOA) connectors. | **Beexo** |
| *(Planned)* Lemon SDK | Native `@lemoncash/mini-app-sdk`. | Lemon |

### 2. Supported MiniApps & Environments

The application behaves differently depending on the access point (Subdomain) and injected providers.

| Platform | Subdomain | Connection Strategy | Auth Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard PWA** | `app.` | **Wagmi SW** | Social / Email / **Passkey** 🆕 / Wallet |
| **Base MiniApp** | `base.` | **Wagmi SW** | Coinbase Smart Wallet |
| **Beexo** | `beexo.` | **Wagmi EOA** | Injected Provider (Beexo) |
| **Lemon (planned)** | `lemon.` | Lemon SDK | Native Lemon Auth |

## ⚖️ How It Works (The Juror Flow)

1. **Enter the Market:** Users open the Slice App or MiniApp and **stake USDC** to join the juror pool.
2. **Get Drafted:** When a dispute arises, jurors are randomly selected (Drafted) to review the case.
3. **Review & Vote:** Jurors analyze the evidence provided by both parties and vote privately on the outcome.
4. **Earn Rewards:** If their vote aligns with the majority consensus, they **earn fees** from the losing party.
5. **Justice Served:** The protocol aggregates the votes and executes the ruling on-chain instantly.

## 🔌 Integration Guide (For Developers)

Integrating Slice into your protocol is as simple as 1-2-3:

### 1. Create a Dispute
Call `slice.createDispute(defender, category, ipfsHash, jurorsRequired)` from your contract.

### 2. Wait for Ruling
Slice handles the juror selection, voting, and consensus off-chain and on-chain.

### 3. Read the Verdict
Once the dispute status is `Executed`, read the `winner` address from the `disputes` mapping and execute your logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Configure Environment

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your keys.

```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV="development" # or 'production'
    
    # Pinata / IPFS Config
    # https://app.pinata.cloud/   
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT="your_pinata_jwt"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY_URL="your_gateway_url"
    
    # Privy Config (For PWA/Base/Farcaster)
    # https://dashboard.privy.io/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="your_privy_app_id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID="your_privy_client_id"
    
    # Supabase Auth (For Passkeys & Email Auth) 🆕
    # https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key" # ⚠️ NEVER expose to client
    
    # Contracts
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SLICE_CONTRACT="0x..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_USDC_CONTRACT="0x..."
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. **Set up Supabase (for Passkey Auth):** 🆕

```bash
    # Apply database migration
    # Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
    # - Copy contents of supabase/migrations/001_create_user_passkeys.sql
    # - Paste in SQL Editor and execute
    
    # Option 2: Via Supabase CLI
    supabase db push
```

* **PWA Mode:** Open `http://localhost:3000`
* **Miniapp Mode:** Use the native testing environment given by the Miniapp SDK.

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

This app supports multiple authentication methods:

### Standard PWA
- **Email/Password** - Traditional authentication
- **Magic Link** - Passwordless email authentication
- **Passkey** 🆕 - Biometric authentication (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello)
- **Social Login** - via Privy (Google, Twitter, etc.)

### Documentation
- 📄 **Passkey Implementation**: See `docs/PASSKEY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- 📄 **Testing Guide**: See `docs/PASSKEY_TESTING.md`
- 📄 **Known Issues**: See `docs/BUGS_AND_EDGE_CASES.md`

## ⚙️ Application Configuration

The `src/config/` and `src/adapters/` directories manage the multi-environment logic.

### Abstraction Layer (`src/adapters/`)

We abstract wallet interactions behind a common interface:

* **`useWalletAdapter`** – Selects the active strategy based on environment.
* **`WagmiAdapter`** – Wraps Wagmi hooks (Smart Wallets or EOA).
* *(Planned)* **`LemonAdapter`** – Will wrap `@lemoncash/mini-app-sdk`.

### Chain Configuration (`src/config/chains.ts`)

* Exports `SUPPORTED_CHAINS` mapping Wagmi `Chain` objects to contract addresses.
* Defaults based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`.

---

## 🔧 Smart Contract Development

The `contracts/` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts using **Hardhat** and **Viem**.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm hardhat compile
pnpm hardhat test
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
```
